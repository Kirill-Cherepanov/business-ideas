# Business Ideas Sharing App

The Business Ideas Sharing App is a simple and user-friendly platform that allows users to share their innovative business ideas with the community. The app is built with Next.js and Material-UI (MUI) for a pleasant and modern user interface. Users can view all the posted ideas without signing up, but to create or edit their own ideas, they are required to sign in using their Google account. The application also features a basic search functionality to help users discover relevant ideas quickly. Furthermore, each user has a personalized profile section that showcases all their submitted posts.
